    <h2>Pedro Moo</h2>
    <p> My name is Pedro Moo (pronounced Moe, ergo my nickname). I live in Monterrey, Mexico.<br>
        I'm married and have two children. I love the outdoors, playing football (soccer) and basketball. <br>
        If anyone is into sports, I'd love to chat some day with you. At any rate, I'd love to chat about anything <br>
        with anyone.
    </p> 
    <p> I'm currently a Scrum Master at a software developing company, so I like programming. <br>
        This is probably my first html class though. I have studied programming before but never web design.<br>
        So, I'm exited to learn front end web development.        
    </p>
    <p> I want to direct my career path into Machine Learning and AI. I find those fields interesting and fun. <br>
        With the Launch of ChatGPT, I can see that's the way to aim my efforts. Besides, someone will have to fix <br>
        broken AI or specialize it. </p>
    <p> Thanks for reading my page. If you ever need some help, please reach out to me and I'd be happy to set up <br>
        something so we can talk (zoom, whatsapp, slack, teams, etc).</p>
    <p> Finally, cooking for others is my passion. Here are some dishes I recenly made.</p>
