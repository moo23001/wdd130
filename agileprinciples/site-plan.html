        Agile can be daunting to implement, especilly if you have anti-agile practices. That's why we created this page,
        to help you understand its principles and know practical ways to implement them. Don't be afraid. Explore with us
        the road to practical agile principle implementation.

      <h3>Why Agile?</h3>
      <p>
        This page is to explain why we have agile. Displays the main resons to implement Agile.
        While Agile is popular, knowing why you want to adopt agile is more important than
        trying to implement it. Agile is a set of principles that guide you in achiveing your ultimate goal.
        Think of it like using a car to get to a destination. Getting to the destination is
        more important than the vehicle you use. But using the correct vehicle will make it
        easier to get to your destination.

      <h3>Agile Manifesto</h3>
      <p>
        The manifesto is where everything branches. Each of these boxes represents guidance to the reader. Images and 
        information are related and should be well spaced with padding like in the wireframe.
        Principles are essential to any organization. The Agile Manifesto provides guidance, limits, and an understanding when everything
        being built or discussed. Agile presents principles not as must-have-rules, but rather as the guiding lanes on
        the road towards the goals we want to achive. Without principles any direction we take is likely the wrong one 
        or the right one, depending on anyones perspective. But with principles we can know if we are building something
        that can be said it's going in the right direction.
